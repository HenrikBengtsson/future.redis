future.redis: A backend for the future package using Redis.

Description

The future package defines very simple and uniform way of evaluating R
expressions asynchronously.

Redis is a fast networked key/value database that includes a stack-like data
structure (Redis "lists").  This feature makes Redis useful as a lightweight
task-queue-like backend for elastic distributed computing.

The future.redis package defines a simple elastic distributed computing backend
for future using the redux package to communicate with Redis.

Here is a quick example procedure for experimenting with future.redis:

1. Install Redis on your computer.
2. Install the future.redis package.
3. Start the redis server running (see the redis documentation). We assume
   that the server is running on the host "localhost" and port 6379 (the
   default Redis port). We assume in the examples below that the worker R
   processes and the coordinator are running on the same machine. In practice,
   they can of course run across a network.
4. See the `?redis` example in the package.
